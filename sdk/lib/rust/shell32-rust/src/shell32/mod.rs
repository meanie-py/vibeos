// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// STILL PARKED. The C++ SUBSTRATE that blocked them is now largely built: `crate::atl` supplies
// CComPtr/CHeapPtr/CComHeapPtr/CSimpleArray and `crate::shellutils` the shellutils.h/utils.h
// header inlines, so what is left per file is ordinary integration work rather than a missing
// foundation. Counts measured with all six wired, after the substrate landed:
//
//     shlexec.rs   349     shlfileop.rs  227     iconcache.rs   68
//     brfolder.rs  244     shlfolder.rs   70     shldataobject   0  <- flipped
//
// Read those against the pre-substrate numbers (shldataobject 22, iconcache 68, shlfolder 75,
// shlfileop 227, brfolder 235, shlexec 415) and note that brfolder went UP, 235 -> 244: making
// the ATL types resolve does not only remove errors, it also un-masks the ones that were hiding
// behind an unresolved name. A rising count on a file is progress, not regression.
//
// What each still needs, in cheapest-first order:
//
//   * iconcache / shlfolder (~70 each) — cast and signature integration, no new substrate.
//   * brfolder (244) — the same, at volume, plus TreeView_* macro residue for the prelude.
//   * shlfileop / shlexec (227 / 349) — both additionally want `CStringW`, which `atl.rs`
//     deliberately does NOT yet provide. Its measured surface is new()/Left/GetLength/IsEmpty/
//     SetString/GetBuffer/ReleaseBuffer/as_ptr/`+=` plus 14 `Format` calls. `Format` is
//     printf-variadic, and stable Rust cannot DEFINE a variadic fn — it needs a trampoline in
//     `dll/win32/shell32/rust_varargs_shim.c`, the same mechanism ShellMessageBoxA already uses.
//     Designing CStringW before that decision is made would be guesswork, so it waits.
//
// Each carries an `//! ORPHAN-BY-DESIGN:` banner. PAID artifacts — do not delete them to tidy up.
